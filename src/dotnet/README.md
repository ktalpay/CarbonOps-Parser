# .NET Implementation

The .NET implementation is an independent Worker Service implementation option for CarbonOps-Parser.

It should follow the same conceptual ingestion workflow as the Python implementation while using .NET-appropriate project structure and typed application architecture.

## Role

The .NET path should focus on:

- Configuration loading.
- PostgreSQL startup checks.
- Schema availability checks.
- Background worker service execution.
- Source-specific schedules.
- Source version/hash checks.
- Raw file download and archive.
- Source-specific parsing.
- Parsed record validation.
- Persistence of shared ingestion metadata and source-specific records.
- Import summaries and validation issues.

The .NET implementation should not depend on the Python implementation.

This documentation baseline does not add Worker Service code, source ingestion logic, database runtime behavior, or external dependencies.
